STEPS TO MAKE IT WORK:

1. Stop current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)

2. Make sure ngrok is running in SEPARATE terminal:
   ngrok http 5000

3. Copy the HTTPS URL from ngrok (like https://abc123.ngrok.io)

4. Go to Twilio Console:
   https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/incoming

5. Click your phone number

6. Under "Voice Configuration":
   A CALL COMES IN:  Webhook
   URL: https://YOUR-NGROK-URL.ngrok.io/voice
   Method: HTTP POST

7. Click SAVE

8. Start server:
   python3 voice_conversational.py

9. Call your Twilio number

10. SPEAK - you should see logs showing:
    - WebSocket connected
    - Stream started  
    - User said: (your speech)
    - LLM decided to call tools
    - Tool results
    - AI response

If WebSocket doesn't connect, the ngrok URL in Twilio is wrong.
